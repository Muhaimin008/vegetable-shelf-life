# 🥔 Vegetable Shelf Life Prediction  

This project focuses on **predicting the shelf life of potatoes** by analyzing their **physical properties, thermal & environmental data, and temporal changes**. We developed a system to estimate **potato shelf life** based on **image-based segmentation, weight & volume estimation, and density calculations**.

## 📌 Project Overview  

🥔 **Potato Image Segmentation** – Extracting potatoes from images taken from different angles.  
📊 **Weight & Volume Estimation** – Measuring potato dimensions to estimate volume and density.  
🌡️ **Thermal & Environmental Monitoring** – Integrating sensor data to analyze temperature and humidity effects.  
🕰️ **Temporal Analysis** – Tracking potato condition over time to predict shelf life.

## 🏗️ Methodology  

### **1️⃣ Image-Based Feature Extraction**  
- Capturing potato images from **multiple angles** for a robust dataset.  
- Performing **potato segmentation** to isolate potatoes from the background.  
- Estimating **weight, volume, and density** using image-based calculations.  

### **2️⃣ Thermal & Environmental Data Integration**  
- Gathering **temperature and humidity readings** from sensor data.  
- Analyzing how **storage conditions affect shelf life**.  

### **3️⃣ Temporal Analysis for Shelf Life Estimation**  
- Monitoring changes in **color, texture, and shrinkage** over time.  
- Using a **time-series approach** to predict when a potato will spoil.
